# React To-Do List Documentation

This application is a simple to-do list manager built using React. It allows users to add, remove, and mark tasks as complete.

## About this project:
It was necessary to create three components to better understand the development of the features.

- Task Management: Add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, and remove tasks.
